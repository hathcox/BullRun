# BullRun — Complete Music & Ambient Track Manifest

> **Style Direction for ALL tracks:** 8-bit retro chiptune foundation with modern production — lo-fi bitcrushed melodies, crunchy square/triangle/pulse waves, but mixed with modern sidechain compression, subtle reverb, and punchy drums. Think: if a Wall Street trading floor existed inside an NES cartridge. Tempo and energy should reflect the financial stakes and emotional arc of a roguelite run.

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Layering Strategy
The music system should support dynamic layering:
- **Base layer:** Act-specific trading music (#3-6)
- **Ambient bed:** Act-specific atmosphere (#29-32) plays beneath at ~15% volume
- **Urgency layer:** Fades in at 15s remaining (#7), swaps to critical at 5s (#8)
- **Event override:** Market Crash (#9) and Bull Run (#10) temporarily replace act music
- **Market hum:** Always-on at ~5% volume (#28)

### Transition Recommendations
- Act music should **crossfade** over 2 seconds when transitioning between acts
- Urgency layer should **fade in** over 1 second when timer threshold is crossed
- Event overrides should **hard-cut in** with a brief 0.1s fade for dramatic impact
- Shop music should **crossfade in** over 1.5 seconds as shop UI animates open
- Victory/defeat stingers play **over** a brief silence before the screen loop begins

### Volume Hierarchy (Suggested Mix)
1. **Stingers:** 100% (momentary, attention-grabbing)
2. **Act Music:** 70% (primary soundtrack)
3. **Dynamic Layers:** 50-60% (additive tension)
4. **Shop Music:** 65% (calmer than combat)
5. **Results/Screen Loops:** 55% (reflective, not dominant)
6. **Ambient Beds:** 10-15% (texture, felt not heard)
7. **CRT Hum:** 3-5% (subliminal)

### Key Musical Motifs
Consider threading a **main theme motif** through multiple tracks for cohesion:
- Title screen introduces the hook
- Act music variations rearrange it per tier
- Victory fanfare reprises it triumphantly
- Defeat melody plays it in minor key
- Shop music plays it gently and warmly

This creates a musical identity that ties the entire audio experience together.
